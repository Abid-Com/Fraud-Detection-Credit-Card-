Objective: Finding Frauds While Tracking Imbalanced Data Sets
         Fraudulent activities can take many forms, from false insurance claims to credit card fraud. No matter the type of fraud, one thing is certain: it costs businesses 
         billions of dollars every year.
         The problem with fraud detection is that it’s hard to distinguish between authentic transactions and false positives. Fraudsters are in such a minority, so predictive 
         models often struggle when they come up against imbalanced data sets like this one – where there might be more predictors for “fraud” than actual cases of fraud being 
         committed.
          Following are the top strategies to detect fraud: 
              Oversampling 
              Undersampling 
              A combined approach 
              With the above 3 methods, you can better train your machine learning model to identify fraud.
